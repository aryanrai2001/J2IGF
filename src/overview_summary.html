    <title>Java 2D Interactive Graphics Framework</title>
</head>
<body>
This is the documentation for J2IGF which is an interactive graphics framework built from scratch in Java.
The goal of this project is to create a framework that has a wide range of options available.
It provides pixel-level control as well as abstract functionalities to generate complex graphics, and lastly,
it is capable of interpreting user input.
<br/>
<b>
    This project is only meant for educational purposes, as it does not use hardware-accelerated rendering,
    and in the present day there is no practical application of software rendering.
    It may still be useful for creating quick visualisations as well as some low-fidelity interactive applications.
    Lastly, it can help develop an understanding of how graphics are rendered under the hood,
    as the fundamentals always remain the same.

<hr/>
The com.j2igf.framework package is the root and provides all the sub-packages of J2IGF which are mentioned below.
