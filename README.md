# Java 2D Interactive Graphics Framework

> As the name suggests, it is an interactive graphics framework built from scratch in Java. The goal of this project is
> to create a framework that has a wide range of options available. It provides pixel-level control as well as abstract
> functionalities to generate complex graphics, and lastly, it is capable of interpreting user input.

### *This project is only meant for educational purposes, as it does not use hardware-accelerated rendering, and in the
present day there is no practical application of software rendering. It may still be useful for creating quick
visualisations as well as some low-fidelity interactive applications. Lastly, it can help develop an understanding of
how graphics are rendered under the hood, as the fundamentals always remain the same.*

TODO :-

- Brief introduction to software rendering and computer graphics.
- Some information about the framework.
- Usage Guide/Link to Documentation.
- Demonstrations of framework capabilities.
